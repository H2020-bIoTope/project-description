# project-description
The Internet of Things (IoT) brings opportunities to create new services and products, reducing costs for societies, and changing how services are sold and consumed. A critical obstacle to further IoT innovation is the “vertical silos” that shape today’s IoT landscape. These silos impede the creation of cross-industry, cross-platform and cross-organisational services due to their lack of interoperability and openness.

The bIoTope project lays the foundation for creating open innovation ecosystems by providing a platform that enables companies to easily create new IoT systems and to rapidly harness available information using advanced Systems-of-Systems (SoS) capabilities for Connected Smart Objects – with minimal investment.
